# Virtual PAPI

Pilots love runways with visual descent guidance, such as PAPI or VASI, but unfortunately they don't exist everywhere.

This app provides an adjustable visual descent guidance for every runway on the planet. The pilot can select an airport, a runway, adjust the desired descent angle and the aiming point, then Virtual PAPI will create a glide slope indicator style.

The glide slope will provide accurate vertical guidance to the aiming point from any direction, 360 degrees, providing valuable guidance for any type of approach, like base entries, short approaches, straight-ins, etc.

The app comes with over 30 thousand runways in its offline database, and more will be added as they are discovered. The app works completely offline and never tries to use the internet. All it needs is access to your location.

You can find it on the Apple's App Store.

## How to contribute

I'm happy to review PRs with some improvements, as long as it's simple and doesn't change much of the app functionality.

Don't send PRs changing anything in the database, as the app uses OurAirport's data, graciously maintained by David Megginson. You can go to [their GitHub project](https://github.com/davidmegginson/ourairports-data) to suggest changes. I'm happy to pull the changes from there.
